<h1>Publist - Publication List Tool</h1>

Publist is a small set of PHP scripts that automates many of the chores involved in maintaining 
and presenting an online publication list. Here are some of Publist's main features:<p>

<ul>
<li> Generates pretty-printed HTML description of publications
<li> Allows sorting of publications by type, date, author, area, or potentially any other criterion
<li> Allows publication sub-lists using any selection criterion (e.g. area)
<li> Full support of HTML4 and CSS3 formatting
<li> Allows embedded HTML in publication fields (enabling URLs, colors, fonts,...)
<li> Includes script to read BibTeX format and convert to XML
<li> Automatic generation of BibTeX files from publication data
<li> Automatic linking to downloadable paper, presentation, BibTeX, abstract and more
<li> 'Reference' mode allows HTML citing of papers just like with BibTeX
<li> Automatically tags as 'New' publications within the last few months (configurable)
<li> Support for team and individual pages from same database
<li> XML input allows simple extension to new fields or types of publications
<li> Use macros for commonly ocurring string substitutions
<li> Optional admin interface to edit publications directly from the web
</ul>


<p>
To see how a full publication list with sort options looks like, check out 
<a href="http://frachtenberg.org/eitan/pubs/">my publications page</a>. 
To see how you can use arbitrary selection criteria to embed partial publication lists in an HTML document, 
have a look at <a href="http://frachtenberg.org/eitan/pubs/research.php">my research page</a>. 
A <a href="http://frachtenberg.org/eitan/pubs/refs.php">demo page</a> 
is also available to see how numbered references can be added to a page.

<h2>Where to get the latest version of publist:</h2>

You can clone (or download) the github repository from <a href="http://github.com/eitanf/publist">here</a><p>

<h2>How to use publist:</h2>
To use publist, you need to create or convert your publication list in XML format. 
Instructions and examples on how to do this are found <a href="format.html">here</a>. 
To get a feeling for what this file looks like, you can have a look at 
<a href="../pubs/pubs.xml">mine</a>.<br>
Having created the list, you'll need to set up publication page(s). 
This might be as simple as renaming your existing HTML page to a .php extension, 
and adding 2-5 lines to it depending on what and how you want to present your publications. 
You may also want to set up directories with downloadable files such as papers, presentations, and abstracts. 
Instructions on how to do all this can be found <a href="usage.html">here</a>.<br>
To get the feeling for what publications pages look like at the source level, 
you can find three php examples (versions of my own lists)
in the examples/ directory of the Publist package.
You should open the examples with an editor and not a browser, to see the PHP code.<p>
